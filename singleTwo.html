							<p>The moment my six-hour flight was over, I could not wait for my feet to touch the ground of San Francisco, California — home of the Silicon Valley! It was a moment that I had been patiently waiting for, and I found myself filled with so much joy and excitement for what was to come during my trip. The opportunity to attend SIGNAL has been the highlight of my year. Now, let me tell you why!</p>

							<p>Twilio’s two-day event was filled with so many new things to learn, great people to meet, and fun things to do. Everyone who I had the privilege of meeting welcomed me with open arms and created the best experience for me at the conference.</p>

							<p>Day one started off with a powerful opening by Jeff Lawson, CEO of Twilio, with the message CODE IS CREATIVE boldly shown behind him. “Code is creative,” Lawson said. “It is more than just math; it is art.” I could not have agreed with him more. I believe code is the type of art that can be used to change the lives of many people.</p>

							<p>After kicking off his talk with an inspiring message about code, Lawson introduced both LaFawn Davis, Global Head of Culture &amp; Inclusion, and Laura Weidman Powers, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Code 2040, who discussed their work and how they are helping to change the face of technology. Both of these women inspired me as I watched them fearlessly speak to such a large audience about their passions and the commitment that they have to make a difference.

 </p>

							<p>Both of their inspirational talks were a great way for all of us to get engaged with the conference and for them to introduce Twilio’s new engineering apprenticeship program called Hatch The Owl, “a 6-month apprenticeship program for people with non-traditional technical backgrounds and belonging to underrepresented groups in tech.”</p>

							<p>After hearing from Powers and Davis, my day was swept away by all of the interesting tech sessions that I attended like Trust by Design, Adventures in Useless Hacking, Lucky: Examining The Barriers to Contributing to Open Source, and Google Machine Learning Natural Language — just to name a few.</p>

							<p>Google Machine Learning Natural Language was one of my favorite sessions! I finally had the opportunity to learn more about machine learning and how APIs play a powerful role in allowing us to extract different entities and sentiments, such as booking a flight, in another language. It was amazing to have been exposed to this new type of technology that companies are using today. At the end of day one, I was pretty exhausted (in a good way) because I had learned so much in such a short period.</p>

							<h2>Day Two was filled with even more exciting tech sessions</h2>
							<p>delicious food, and networking. However, for every ending, there is always a new beginning. On the final day, Twilio gave the stage to Tanmay, a 13-year-old boy who had the opportunity to demo first his drone!</p>
							<p>In the end, what I truly took away from this conference as a developer is that we are at the center of all of this positive impact happening in the world. It makes me feel good to know that I have decided to help contribute something to the greater good. Hopefully, this will inspire you to do so too!</p>

							<p> SIGNAL is the annual developer conference by Twilio, hosted in San Francisco and London. SIGNAL San Francisco will be back October 2018. Check out the 2017 recap here.</p>
